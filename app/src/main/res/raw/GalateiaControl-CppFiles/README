The contents of this directory need to be added to the computer that
controls a Pioneer 2 AT robot.

The code uses the Mobile Robots's Library to the ARIA robot, Aria 2.9.0 which
allows an external computer to connect to the robot via serial port. After downloading the
library you will need to compile the GalateiaControl.cpp and execute it on the
console.

The execution will make the robot waits until a client connects allowing the client
send motion commands that can be checked on the source code.
